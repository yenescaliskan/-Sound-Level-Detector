# Sound Level Detector
In this project, our goal is to design a sound level detector circuit that contains pulse width modulation circuit to adjust the duty cycle of signals with respect to environmental sound level and displays those different duty cycle by a LED. Our circuit design generally consists of 3 units. The first unit, the input unit, consists of a microphone circuit that converts environmental sounds to our input voltage. The decision unit, which is the second unit, consists of a circuit which produces PWM signals according to the 4 different sound levels requested from us by evaluating the received input. The output unit, which is the last unit, consists of a LED circuit that flashes according to the PWM signals produced and shows us the sound level.
